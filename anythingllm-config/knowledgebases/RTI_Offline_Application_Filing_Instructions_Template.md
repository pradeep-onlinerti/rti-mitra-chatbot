# How to File Your RTI Application Offline

Print the Application

Print the RTI draft provided above on a plain A4 sheet of paper.

Fill in Your Personal Details

Enter your full name, complete address, contact number, and the date on the application (if not already included).

Attach Supporting Documents (if any)

If your RTI draft mentions any supporting documents (e.g., ID proof, previous correspondence), attach clear photocopies of those.

Identify the Correct Government Office / PIO

Find out which government office your application should be sent to. This is usually the department that holds the information you’re requesting. Address it to the Public Information Officer (PIO) of that office.

Pay the RTI Application Fee

Depending on whether your RTI is for a Central or State Government department, the application fee and payment method may vary.

Send the Application via Registered Post or Speed Post Only

Submit the completed application along with any supporting documents and proof of fee payment using Registered Post or Speed Post from India Post.

⚠️ Avoid private courier services — many government offices do not accept them beyond the main gate or after entry-level security, whereas India Post deliveries are allowed all the way to internal dispatch sections.

 🔖 Keep the postal receipt safely, as it serves as proof of filing and is needed for follow-up or appeal.
